# CS52 SA3 Starter Pack

*A starter pack for front-end web development. Includes webpack-dev-server, babel, lint, and sass/css.*

[deployed url](http://sada-cs52-starter.surge.sh)

## What Worked Well
The timer countdown worked well, everything seemed to display as I wanted it to and the deployed surge url works.

## What Didn't
For some reason, installing surge with "-g" caused errors, so I downloaded it without that option; everything works fine, but I don't know if that will be a problem in the future.
